/**
 Represents a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate, providing methods to convert between latitude/longitude and UTM coordinates.

 UTM is a global map projection system that divides the world into 60 longitudinal zones, each 6Â° wide, and projects coordinates onto a transverse Mercator projection for each zone. This struct encapsulates all necessary parameters for a single UTM coordinate, including:

 - `zone`: The UTM longitudinal zone (valid range: 1...60)
 - `hemisphere`: The hemisphere of the coordinate (.northern or .southern)
 - `easting`: The easting value in meters within the zone
 - `northing`: The northing value in meters within the zone
 - `convergence`: The meridian convergence at this point, in degrees
 - `scale`: The point scale factor at this location
 - `locationCoordinate2D`: The original CLLocationCoordinate2D for reference

 The `UTM` struct offers:
 - Validation for legal zone, easting, and northing values (with support for both standard and stricter MGRS limits)
 - Conversion from geographic (latitude, longitude) coordinates into UTM, and vice versa
 - Support for direct initialization from UTM parameters or from Core Location coordinates

 Throws errors if any of the zone, easting, or northing parameters are out of bounds.
